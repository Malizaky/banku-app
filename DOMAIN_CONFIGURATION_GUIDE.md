## 🔧 Custom Domain Setup Steps

### Step 1: Railway Dashboard Configuration

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Login to your account

2. **Select Your BankU Project**
   - Find your deployed BankU application
   - Click on the project

3. **Go to Settings → Domains**
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Find "Domains" section
   - Click "Add Domain"

4. **Add Your Custom Domain**
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `allnd.me`)
   - Click "Add"
   - Railway will provide DNS records

### Step 2: DNS Configuration

**Railway will provide these DNS records:**

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-app.railway.app

Type: CNAME  
Name: @ (root domain)
Value: your-app.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Configure DNS in Namecheap

1. **Login to Namecheap**
   - Go to your Namecheap account
   - Access domain management

2. **Go to Advanced DNS**
   - Select your domain
   - Click "Advanced DNS" tab

3. **Add DNS Records**
   ```
   Type: CNAME Record
   Host: www
   Value: your-app.railway.app
   TTL: Automatic

   Type: CNAME Record
   Host: @
   Value: your-app.railway.app
   TTL: Automatic
   ```

4. **Remove Default Records**
   - Delete any existing A records for @ and www
   - Keep only the CNAME records above

### Step 4: Wait for Propagation

- **DNS propagation**: 5-60 minutes
- **SSL certificate**: 5-10 minutes after DNS
- **Check status**: Railway dashboard will show status

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Domain Not Working?

**Check These:**
1. **DNS Records**: Verify CNAME records are correct
2. **Propagation**: Use [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) to check
3. **Railway Status**: Check Railway dashboard for errors
4. **SSL Certificate**: Wait for automatic SSL setup

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Domain shows Railway page**
- **Cause**: DNS not fully propagated
- **Solution**: Wait 10-15 minutes

**Issue 2: SSL certificate not working**
- **Cause**: DNS still propagating
- **Solution**: Wait for DNS + SSL setup

**Issue 3: Domain not accessible**
- **Cause**: Incorrect DNS records
- **Solution**: Verify CNAME records in Namecheap

## 📊 DNS Record Examples

Record Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: banku-app-production.railway.app
