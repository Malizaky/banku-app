  - Database health checks
  - Application-specific metrics
  - Alert thresholds and notifications

### 8. Startup Validation
- **Location**: `startup_check.py`
- **Purpose**: Validates system requirements before startup
- **Features**:
  - Python version compatibility check
  - Dependency availability verification
  - Directory structure validation
  - Database connectivity testing
  - File system permissions check

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Starting the Application Safely
```bash
# Run startup checks first
python startup_check.py

# If checks pass, start the application
python app.py
```

### Health Monitoring Endpoints
- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/health/detailed` - Detailed system status
- `/health/monitoring/start` - Start background monitoring
- `/health/monitoring/stop` - Stop background monitoring

### Error Handling Decorators
```python
from utils.error_handling import safe_route_handler, log_errors

@safe_route_handler()
@log_errors
def my_route():
    # Your route code here
    pass
```

### File Upload Validation
```python
from utils.file_utils import validate_uploaded_file_comprehensive

is_valid, error_message, file_info = validate_uploaded_file_comprehensive(
    file=uploaded_file,
    allowed_extensions=['jpg', 'png'],
    max_size=10 * 1024 * 1024,
    allowed_categories=['images']
)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Database Connection Pooling
```python
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS'] = {
    'poolclass': 'QueuePool',
    'pool_size': 10,
    'pool_recycle': 3600,
    'pool_pre_ping': True,
    'max_overflow': 20,
    'pool_timeout': 30
}
```

### Health Monitoring Thresholds
```python
alert_thresholds = {
    'cpu_usage': 80.0,
    'memory_usage': 85.0,
    'disk_usage': 90.0,
    'response_time': 5.0,
    'error_rate': 5.0,
    'db_connections': 80
}
```

## üìä Monitoring and Alerts

### System Metrics Tracked
- CPU usage percentage
- Memory usage and availability
- Disk usage and free space
- Database connection pool status
- Application response times
- Error rates and types

### Alert Levels
- **Healthy**: All systems operating normally
- **Warning**: Some metrics approaching thresholds
- **Critical**: System stability at risk

### Logging
- All errors are logged with full context
- Performance metrics are tracked
- User actions are logged for debugging
- System health status is continuously monitored

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Database Connection Errors
- Check database server status
- Verify connection pool settings
- Review database logs for errors

#### File Upload Failures
- Check file size limits
- Verify file type restrictions
- Ensure upload directory permissions

#### Memory Issues
- Monitor system resources
- Check for memory leaks in data collectors
- Review application logs for patterns

#### Permission Errors
- Verify user roles and permissions
- Check database relationships
- Review permission system logs

## üîí Security Considerations

### File Upload Security
- All uploaded files are validated
- Filenames are sanitized
- File types are restricted
- Size limits are enforced

### Session Security
- Session data is validated
- Organization access is verified
- Invalid sessions are cleaned up
- Session IDs are securely generated

### Error Information Disclosure
- Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- Detailed errors are logged but not shown to users
- Generic error messages are provided to users

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimizations
- Connection pooling reduces overhead
- Query optimization with proper indexing
- Connection recycling prevents stale connections

### Memory Management
- Resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Background task management
- Efficient data structure usage

### File Handling
- Streamed file processing
- Efficient file validation
- Optimized upload handling

## üß™ Testing

### Health Check Testing
```bash
# Test basic health
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Test detailed health
curl http://localhost:5000/health/detailed
```

### Startup Check Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive startup checks
python startup_check.py
```

### Error Handling Testing
- Test with invalid file uploads
- Test with database connection issues
- Test with permission violations
- Test with network timeouts

## üìù Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor health check endpoints
- Review error logs regularly
- Update dependency versions
- Clean up old log files
- Monitor system resources

### Updates and Patches
